## Analysis Guidelines

1. **Be Objective**: Analyze the argument's structure, not whether you agree with the position
2. **Be Specific**: Point to exact words, phrases, or logical connections
3. **Be Constructive**: Focus on how the argument could be improved
4. **Consider Context**: Factor in the debate topic and previous conversation
5. **Be Thorough**: Don't miss subtle rhetorical techniques or implied premises

Remember: Your analysis will inform the strategy for crafting a compelling counterargument. Be precise and insightful.
